<Info>
We recommend to install Keep CLI with Python version 3.11 for optimal compatibility and performance.
This choice ensures seamless integration with all dependencies, including pyarrow, which currently does not support Python 3.12
</Info>

<Tip>Need Keep CLI on other versions? Feel free to contact us! </Tip>

## Clone and install (Option 1)

### Install
First, clone Keep repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Install Keep CLI with `pip`:

```shell
pip install .
```
or with `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:

```
keep version
```

### Test
Get a Slack Incoming Webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use use Keep to configure it

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```
Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/...) and you're good to go ðŸ‘Œ

Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/workflows/db_disk_space.yml
```

Congrats ðŸ¥³ You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.


## Docker image (Option 2)
### Install

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

### Test
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```


## Enable Auto Completion
Keep's CLI supports shell auto-completion, which can make your life a whole lot easier ðŸ˜Œ
If you're using zsh

```shell title=~/.zshrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=zsh_source keep)"
```

If you're using bash

```bash title=~/.bashrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=bash_source keep)"
```

<Info>Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness. To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.</Info>
